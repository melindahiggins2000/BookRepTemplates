<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 2</span> Setup your tools and get started</h1>
<p>This chapter will cover the software tools needed - installing R, RStudio, GIT and Github to get started. And will include installing the various packages needed for the exercises in this book.</p>
<div id="r" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> R</h2>
<p>So what is R? R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. R is based on the S language and environment which was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&amp;T, now Lucent Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues.</p>
<p>R is Free - both in terms of no cost but also as FREELY distributed and shared under the GNU general public licensing.</p>
<p>To learn more about R, you should visit the R-project website. This site provides good information about what R is, who the key contributors are, and information about the development of the R language. Links are provided for the manuals, frequently asked questions, and other resources like books about R and “The R Journal”. At the top of the page is a link to CRAN or C-RAN where you can download the R software.</p>
<p>Go ahead to the CRAN website to download R. The link from the R project website, takes you to the list of “mirrors” or servers around the world that host the code and files and installers for installing R. You should pick the mirror closest to your geographic location. For example, at the bottom is the list of mirror sites for the United States. The one hosted by Duke University is closest to my location.</p>
<p>You can also access this download page by directly going to <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">https://cran.r-project.org/</a> At the top, there are links for the different operating systems for Windows, Mac or Linux. Choose the one for your operating system. For Windows, you’ll want to click on the link for the “base” installer. This will take you to a page with a link to the executable (EXE) file that you’ll need to download and run to install R on a Windows computer. When you click on the link for the Mac operating system, you are provided the link to the package (PKG) file needed to install R on your Mac.</p>
<p>Go ahead and take a few minutes to download the installer needed for your operating system. Run the installer, follow the instructions, and accept the defaults to install R on your computer.</p>
<p>Once R is installed, for example, on a windows computer, you will see R listed in your <code>/Start/Programs</code> list and may also have the R program icons shown on your desktop.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that this is the minimum software you need to use R. For example, we can run the R program and when it opens you get a simple command line interface. You can use this to submit and execute R commands. For example: you can do simple math like typing in <code>2+2</code>, or finding the mean of an array of numbers like <code>mean(c(1,2,3,4,5))</code>. Try this out on your computer to test and make sure R is up and running on your system before installing RStudio.</p>
</div>
<div id="rstudio" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> RStudio</h2>
<p>Programming in R using the basic interface is not the best way. Let’s also go ahead and download and install the RStudio software. RStudio is a fully integrated development environment (IDE) and is the key interface we’ll use for the rest of the course. Not only does RStudio link directly to R and provide a much better programming interface, RStudio allows you to create great rmarkdown documents in multiple formats and then links everything to your Github repository with version control using Git. We’ll cover Github and Git in the next lesson.</p>
<p>Go to <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">https://www.rstudio.com/</a> I encourage you to explore the many other products and services available from the RStudio organization. Check out their resources, which include free webinars, videos, and online learning.</p>
<p>But let’s go ahead and download and install RStudio. Go to products and click on RStudio desktop. We will be using the FREE Open Source edition. Click on Download RStudio Desktop. Click the download button for the FREE version – this scrolls down to a list of installers. You need to read the file names to find the one right for your operating system. The first link is for the Windows installer, next is Mac followed by various flavors of Linux. You’ll want the “Installers” not the “TarBalls or “Source Code” – these are primarily for developers.</p>
<p>Go ahead and take a few minutes to download and install RStudio and get it up and running on your computer.</p>
<p>Once RStudio is up and running, you should see something that looks like this. We will explore this interface further in future lessons, but for now, let’s look at a few basic things. The main window on the left is the same basic “console/command line” window that you saw when you ran the basic R software. Like before, we can type commands and R code here. Like <code>2+2</code> and <code>mean(c(1,2,3,4,5))</code>. But you’ll notice there are more windows on the right side including information on your environment, history, files, plots, packages, help and viewer. To learn more about the RStudio interface, I’ve included several helpful links in a reading page after this video lecture. There are literally thousands of resources for learning more about both R and RStudio. Just pick your favorite search engine and search for tutorials on R and RStudio.</p>
</div>
<div id="github" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Github</h2>
<p>So what is Github? It’s a cloud repository, which hosts things like code, files and documents. It’s very similar to Dropbox, Google drive and Microsoft’s One Drive.</p>
<p>However, Github also includes version control and tracking using Git, which we’ll get to shortly. Github has a web-based interface that includes support for desktop and mobile integration.</p>
<p>Github provides access control and collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis.</p>
<p>It also has native support and interpretation of markdown that’s much easier to use and write than HTML. We’re going to learn more about markdown at the end of this module.</p>
<p>So let’s set up your Github account. Go to <a href="https://github.com">https://github.com</a>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Choose a Good Username for Your Github Account</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Pick something professional that represents you.</li>
<li>This will be your identity on Github and will be viewable by everyone.</li>
<li>NOTE: For this course, I assume that you are creating a PUBLIC Github account, which is FREE. You can create a PRIVATE Github account for a fee.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>You can register one Github account per email.</p></li>
<li><p>Once you get logged into your Github Account, go to your account settings to customize your photo, bio, email, website URL, and more…</p></li>
<li><p>When you first get started you won’t have any repositories, but we will be creating repositories for each project.

</ol>
<p>[NOTES TO MYSELF - COMPUTER DEMO]</p>
<ul>
<li>Show create account and log in screen</li>
<li>Once you are signed in, click on the icon on the top right – click the pull down arrow to see selection options…such as accessing your profile and settings</li>
<li>Click on your settings – check your name and email. These are IMPORTANT – you need to know these to set up Git for version control and connectivity from your cloud account to your local computer</li>
<li>Add your bio summary, a URL, your photo, and any other information you want to share with everyone</li>
<li>View your profile page – this is your “home” on Github – your page will look different from mine. When you first create your account you won’t have any repositories. However, we will be creating new repositories for this course shortly.</li>

<div id="git" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> GIT</h2>
<p>Details in installing GIT</p>
<p>Now that you have your Github account created and you are logged in, we’re going to install Git. GIT is a source code management system for software development. It was designed and developed in 2005 by the Linux developers.</p>
<p>GIT is a distributed version control system with complete history &amp; version-tracking capabilities. You may have heard of other version control systems, like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase.</p>
<p>Unlike some of these, GIT is FREE (cost) and freely distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License.</p>
<p>[BEGIN computer demo]</p>
<p>[NOTES TO MYSELF - COMPUTER DEMO]</p>
<ul>
<li>Download and install Git from <a href="https://git-scm.com/">https://git-scm.com/</a> - click “Downloads” – at the lower left side of the web page</li>
<li>This opens another web page. This page has the links for downloading the installer files for Mac, Linux and Windows operating systems. Choose the download link for your operating system – NOTE: Clicking these links starts the file download.</li>
<li>Run the installer you just downloaded to install Git on your computer. Follow the instructions and accept the defaults.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example on my windows computer, I can go to the start programs and see that Git was installed and has 3 options for running GIT:</p>
<ul>
<li>Git Bash – for this course we will use the Git Bash option</li>
<li>Git CMD</li>
<li>And Git GUI</li>

<li>Click on your Profile, and then Click on Repositories – now we’re going to create a new repository</li>
<li>Click NEW to create a new repository.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>type in a name for your repository such as “MyFirstRepo”</li>
<li>put in a short description like “My First Github Repository”</li>
<li>this will be a PUBLIC repository, but as you can see if you have paid for a PRIVATE Github account you do have the option to create Private repositories</li>
<li>Go ahead and click the box to select “Initialize this repository with a README”</li>
<li>keep everything else the same (use the defaults)</li>
<li>click “Create Repository”</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>It takes a moment for the repository to be created, but you’ll notice that your repository now has 1 file in it. README.md, which is your readme for the repository.</p>
<p>Now we’re going to connect everything back to your local drive using Git.</p>
<p>We need to create a place on your local drive where you want to save your work for this course. We’re going to end up creating multiple repositories for this course, so I create a central folder on your computer like <code>C:\RepTemplates</code> where you’ll keep everything organized.</p>
<p>You can see this folder created on my computer. It is this folder where I will store and link all of my Github repositories for this course.</p>
<p>Let’s go ahead and run GIT. As I mentioned, we will use the Git Bash command window for running and executing GIT commands.</p>
<p>Once the GIT Bash window opens, you’ll see some information and details in the window about what directory/folder it’s currently in. On my system, GIT Bash defaults to my “users” directory.</p>
<p>However, we want to change out of this directory. Keep typing</p>
<p><code>cd ..</code></p>
<p>until you get to the main “C” drive. Then we’re going to change to the RepTemplates folder we just created. Type</p>
<p><code>cd RepTemplates</code></p>
<p>You should see the directory folder change at the GIT Bash command line, but you can also type the command</p>
<p><code>pwd</code></p>
<p>To get the “path with directory” to verify that you ended in your <code>C:\RepTemplates</code> folder as intended.</p>
<p>We can also view the contents of this folder, by typing either</p>
<p><code>ls</code></p>
<p>To “list” the files in this directory or you can also type</p>
<p><code>dir</code></p>
<p>To get a “directory” listing of the contents. You’ll notice at the moment there is nothing in this folder. That’s fine. That’s correct. In a minute we’re going to link back up to our newly create Github repository “MyFirstRepo”.</p>
<p>[END computer demo]</p>
<p>As we go through this course, I will refer many times to the book by Jenny Bryan entitled: Happy Git and Github for the useR</p>
<p>You can access this book for FREE online at <a href="http://happygitwithr.com/">http://happygitwithr.com/</a> There’s a lot of good information on setting up R and RStudio and for getting setup using Git and Github.</p>
<p>[BEGIN computer demo]</p>
<p>Now to get started using GIT, you need to “introduce yourself.” At this point, you should already be logged into your Github account. But we need to make sure that GIT understands how to talk to your Github account. So, we’re going to type in 3 GIT commands in your GIT Bash window. Open your GIT Bash window.</p>
<p>This first command tells GIT your name – be sure to type in the same name you used when you set up your Github account. Your name goes between the 2 single quote marks.</p>
<p><code>git config --global user.name 'Jennifer Bryan'</code></p>
<p>Next we also have to tell GIT the email account you used when you set up your Github account. Again put your email in between the 2 single quote marks.</p>
<p><code>git config --global user.email 'jenny@stat.ubc.ca'</code></p>
<p>Finally, to check to make sure everything went in correctly, type in the following GIT command to list your global settings and you should see the user.name and user.email you just typed in.</p>
<p><code>git config --global –list</code></p>
<p>If you see these, CONGRATULATIONS you have successfully introduced yourself to GIT!!</p>
<p>KEEP your GIT Bash window open.</p>
<p>[END computer demo]</p>
<p>“pushmi-pullyu” SLIDE with PUSH / PULL GRAPHIC – insert here</p>
<p>We’ll be using the terms PUSH and PULL to talk about moving files back and forth from our local computer to the Github cloud repository and from the cloud back to our local computer.</p>
<p>The “pushmi-pullyu” was a fictional animal in the Doctor Dolittle series of children’s books by Hugh Lofting with two heads on opposite ends of its body, so you never knew if the animal was coming or going.</p>
<p>Hopefully, we won’t have that confusion in this course, but we will be PUSH’ing and PULL’ing content in and out of your project repository between your local computer and your Github account using Git version control.</p>
<p>A PULL moves content from the cloud to your local computer.</p>
<p>A PUSH moves content from your local computer to the cloud.</p>
<p>[BEGIN computer demo]</p>
<p>Now let’s CLONE your Github repository to copy the repository contents from your Github cloud repository down to your local computer.</p>
<p>Open your browser, and go to your “MyFirstRepo” repository. At the top right, there’s a green button to “Clone or Download” your repository. Just below that green button, there’s a little icon to the right to “copy to the clipboard” the long URL address you will need when we use GIT to clone your repository.</p>
<p>[END computer demo]</p>
<p>First PULL to Clone your repository SLIDE – insert graphic illustrating a PULL from the cloud</p>
<p>When you CLONE your repository, this is your first PULL. You will be PULLing the content down from your Github account to your local computer.</p>
<p>[BEGIN computer demo]</p>
<p>To execute a clone using GIT, open your GIT Bash window. Check to make sure you are in your <code>C:\RepTemplates</code> directory.</p>
<p>Go back to the “MyFirstRepo” repository and click “copy to clipboard” to get the Github repo URL. Make sure you have the option for “Clone with HTTPS” shown to get the correct URL.</p>
<p>Back in GIT Bash, Type git clone followed by the URL. Since the URL is now COPYied into your “clipboard”, you can PASTE it into the GIT Bash window</p>
<p><code>git clone https://github.com/melindahiggins2001/MyFirstRepo.git</code></p>
<p>This will take a minute to run, but it should say that it is cloning your repository and you should not get any errors.</p>
<p>Now type in a ls or dir command to view the contents of your directory. You should now see a new folder created called “MyFirstRepo” in your <code>C:\RepTemplates</code> directory.</p>
<p>Then type in</p>
<p><code>cd MyFirstRepo</code></p>
<p>to change into this new directory and type ls or dir to view the contents. VIOLA!! You should now see the <code>README.md</code> file in this directory.</p>
<p>You can also see this file by viewing the directory contents in your file explorer. You may also be able to see a hidden folder called <code>/.git</code> which was created when you did the clone. If you can’t see this folder, that’s OK- it’s usually hidden by default. I changed the settings on my computer so I can view these hidden folders.</p>
<p>[END computer demo]</p>
<p>TADA!! You have now successfully cloned your Github repository and have it linked from your local computer to Github using version control and tracking with GIT!!</p>
<p>We’re going to do this again in the next part using the RStudio interface.</p>
</div>
<div id="using-the-rstudio-interface" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.8</span> Using the RStudio Interface</h2>
<p>Let’s take a moment and look at some of the other content in the Happy Git and Github for the user book by Jenny Bryan. <a href="http://happygitwithr.com/">http://happygitwithr.com/</a>.</p>
<p>There are many chapters in this book you may want to read and take a look at. For example, chapter 5 has information on setting up a Github account and chapter 6 has information on installing or upgrading both R and RStudio which you’ve already done. And chapter 7 covers installing Git which you’ve also already done.</p>
<p>Then in Chapter 8 there is information on introducing yourself to GIT which you’ve just completed.</p>
<p>If you would like to move beyond using just the Git Bash window and command line interface for using Git for version control, I recommend reading Chapter 9 on installing a more full-featured Git client. Jenny Bryan recommends either SourceTree or GitKracken.</p>
<p>Chapter 10 covers getting connected to Github which you just completed.</p>
<p>We’re going to spend some time in this next part of the lesson, learning about setting up credentials on your computer using either HTTPS or SSH to securely connect to your Github account. These details are covered in chapters 11 and 12.</p>
<p>There is additional information in chapters 13, 14 and 15 on using RStudio with Git to connect to Github and manage your projects. I will be showing you how to use RStudio to connect to Github using Git shortly.</p>
<p>The later chapters 16, 17 and 18 provide examples of linking up projects with Github depending on whether the project is new or existing and whether you setup the project on Github first or last. For the projects we will be doing in this course, we will be creating new projects by setting up Github first.</p>
<p>The next section of the book provides some workflow examples. I point out Chapter 22 which covers Git commands some of which you’ve already learned. I also mention Chapter 26 entitled Burn it all down which is helpful to read when you have problems and Git stops communicating between Github and RStudio.</p>
<p>Now we’re going to connect to your Github account using Git but from the RStudio interface instead of from the Git Bash window. Go ahead and start RStudio.</p>
<p>When you open RStudio you should see a screen similar to this but it won’t look exactly like this and that is OK. Your layout should be similar. There are a few options we need to review and setup to make sure that RStudio known that you want to use Git.</p>
<p>In the tools menu, click on Global options. Click on the button for GIT/SVN. In this window we want to make sure that the box is checked for “enable version control interface for RStudio projects”. Next we need to find where the GIT executable file is located on your computer. On my computer it is located on my program files folder for Git/bin. For example, if I click browse it shows where this is on my computer’s hard drive. You’ll notice that the file is named “git.exe” and is located in the “/bin” folder. You may also see an icon like the one shown here next to the filename. There is also a similar file under the “/cmd” folder, but this is NOT the one we want. We also DO NOT want the file for “git-bash.exe” NOR the one names “git-cmd.exe”</p>
<p>Also make sure you have the box checked for “Use Git Bash as shell for Git projects”. This why I showed you earlier how to use the Git Bash shell window with your projects.</p>
<p>Since we’re not using SVN you can ignore the line for SVN executable</p>
<p>[END COMPUTER DEMO]</p>
<p>[BACK TO SLIDES]</p>
<p>Now that we’ve got some of the options setup in RStudio for using Git, we next need to setup your Github account credentials on your computer so that each time you run a GIT command to connect and sync to your Github account you won’t have to keep typing in your login name and password. You can setup your credentials by using either HTTPS (hyper text transfer protocol secure) or SSH (Secure Shell). These are two different approaches for setting up your credentials. I’m going to show you how to setup SSH from RStudio.</p>
<p>[BEGIN COMPUTER DEMO]</p>
<p>Back in RStudio in the Global options window for Git/SVN options, were going to setup your SSH RSA Key. This is for setting up a public key/private key cryptosystem. Click on the button to “Create RSA Key” and use the defaults. This is where you create the key. You can add a pass phrase or password, but this is optional. Note where on your hard drive it tells you where the security key will be created. Then click “create” to create your key. If you’d like to view your public key, click on the link to the right. Once you’re done, click OK</p>
<p>Let’s double check that GIT also now sees your SSH Key. Open your Git Bash window and type in this command</p>
<p><code>ls –al ~/.ssh</code></p>
<p>When you do this, you should see two files <code>id_rsa</code> (which is your private key) and <code>id_rsa.pub</code> (which is your public key). This is explained in more detail in the Happy Git book in chapter 12.2. You can also click the <code>[?]</code> Using Version Control with RStudio to get to the help webpages at RStudio.</p>
<p>Make sure you are in the local directory for your new repository <code>C:/RepTemplates/MyFirstRepo</code>. You should see this listed in your Git Bash window prompt or you can also type pwd to get the “path with directory”</p>
<p>You can double check your settings in the git bash window by typing</p>
<p><code>git config –global --list</code></p>
<p>You should be pretty much setup and ready to go at this point. If you are still getting errors, you might have a credentialing conflict. For example, if you have multiple Github accounts with different emails, you might have to remove one credential and add the other one instead. Search Stack Overflow <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">https://stackoverflow.com/</a> or the Github help documentation <a href="https://help.github.com/">https://help.github.com/</a> for help.</p>
<p>Let’s go back to RStudio and create a New Project.</p>
