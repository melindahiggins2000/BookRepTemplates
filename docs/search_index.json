["history.html", "Chapter 1 History &amp; Exemplars 1.1 Reproducible Research 1.2 Literate Programming 1.3 Dynamic Documentation", " Chapter 1 History &amp; Exemplars 1.1 Reproducible Research So why is reproducible research important and incredibly beneficial? Let’s take a look at its beginnings to find the answer. In the early ’90s, a geophysicist named Jon Claerbout revised his book Earth Soundings Analysis with a valid complaint. He claimed that few published results are reproducible in any practical sense. To verify them requires almost as much effort as it took to create them in the first place. After a time, even the authors are often unable to reproduce their own results! For these reasons, many people ignore most of the literature. Then, in 1996, the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (or CONSORT) published a set of guidelines to fix problems that developed from inadequate reporting of randomized controlled trials. Following their lead, in 2004, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors stated they wouldn’t publish a clinical trial that had not been registered, and that they would only endorse registries meeting several key criteria, including that they must be: free and publicly accessible, open to all prospective registrants, managed by a non-profit organization, and electronically searchable and validated As a result of this turmoil in validity and research, the Food and Drug Administration got on board and required the registration of even more clinical trials. The Journal of Biostatistics also encouraged reproducible practices of author submissions. They began marking accepted papers based on the standards of reproducibility that were followed. For example, papers marked with a ‘D’ marking meant the data on which the study is based is freely available. A ‘C’ marking means the authors’ code is freely available. And an ‘R’ marking is the gold standard, meaning that not only are the data and code freely available, but the associate editor for reproducibility was also able to reproduce the same results as the paper. An example of an article given the highest designation for a fully reproducible article is one published in 2009 entitled “Air pollution and health in Scotland: a multicity study.” To see the article’s marking, you have to download the PDF and look for the marking letter in a bold box at the top right. Most compelling, in the early 2000s, John Ioannidis published an article with the highest downloads in the history of the Public Library of Science. It was entitled “Why most published research findings are false.” Despite multiple organizations attempting to fix this issue, the Open Science Collaboration revealed in 2015 that they were only able to reproduce or replicate between 30-50% of the results from more than 100 studies. Ziemann, et.al. in 2016 also found that 20% of papers published in leading genomics journals have supplementary data files containing erroneous gene name conversions due to Microsoft Excel default settings. This 20% is an average, and some journals have even higher rates. But this isn’t new. In 2011, Alsheikh-Ali [Al shake], et.al. assessed 500 research papers with unsettling results. Of these 500 papers sent to high-impact research journals, 30% were not subject to any data availability policy. The papers that adhered to the data availability instructions did so by publicly depositing only the specific data type as required, making a statement of willingness to share, or actually sharing all the primary data. Overall, only 47 papers (that’s only 9%!) deposited full primary raw data online. In the last several years, reproducibility errors have been at the center of some major controversies. In 2010, a published cancer clinical trial at Duke University was tested by two MD Anderson researchers, Keith Baggerly and Kevin Coombs. They found numerous spreadsheet errors leading to misalignment and incorrect assignment of cancer treatment therapies. Because of this, four papers published by the Duke team were retracted, the Duke lead scientist resigned, and Duke shut down three other trials using these results, and many patients have pursued legal action. Another famous study, often called the “excel-error heard round the world” – was based on a paper by two well-known economists at Harvard, Kenneth Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart. In their paper “Growth in a Time of Debt”, the authors claimed that countries whose debt exceeds 90 percent of their annual gross domestic product experience slower growth than countries with lower debt — a figure that’s been cited by many people in order to justify slashing government spending. But when Thomas Herndon, a 28-year-old economics graduate student at the University of Massachusetts tried to reproduce the results, he discovered a major formula error in the excel data spreadsheet. The original paper had excluded key data from the countries of Canada, New Zealand, and Australia — all countries that experienced solid growth during periods of high debt and thus undercut the conclusion that high debt forestalls growth. Due to these critical moments in the last few decades, reproducibility continues to grow as new policies are adopted and the practices are applied. But part of the benefit of being in this course is that you get to be part of the reproducible research movement! 1.2 Literate Programming In 1991, around the same time Jon Claerbout coined the term “reproducible research”, the computer scientist, Donald Knuth, introduced the concept of “literate programming.” The idea of literate programming is that software/computer programs are written in a language humans can understand rather than a language only machines can understand. In literate programming, computer code is embedded within the program’s documentation as opposed to the documentation embedded within computer code; the code follows the structure of the documentation. The program that Donald Knuth used to implement his idea of “literate programming” was called WEB, which he introduced in 1981. WEB linked the TeX typesetting or formatting system for creating documents with the Pascal computer programming language. WEB was one of the first systems to directly link documentation creation and typesetting with computer programming. Donald Knuth chose the name WEB because it implied a program of ideas pieced together from simple materials. Since WEB was introduced, many other programs implementing literate programming have emerged. Here are a few to give you an idea of the variety available. CWEB also created by Donald Knuth with Silvio Levy which was adapted for the C and C++ compute language instead of Pascal Axiom developed by IBM Noweb Literate Funnel WEB Molly Codnar Jupyter Notebook (formerly IPython Notebook) and R Notebooks 1.3 Dynamic Documentation So literate programming is an approach that moves away from writing computer programs in a high-level machine language and instead combines programming language with documentation language so that the program reads almost like an essay or a piece of literature. But what about dynamic documentation? Dynamic documentation allows for constant change and is a tool that provides up-to-date reports if certain components, such as data or analysis, change. In 2002, Friederich Leisch, a statistics professor from the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences in Vienna, released the SWEAVE program for dynamic documentation generation. Notably, SWEAVE allows R code to be embedded within LaTeX documents. LaTeX is a more modern version of the TeX typesetting program used by Donald Knuth. The really exciting feature of literate programming and dynamic documentation is highlighted in what Friedrich Leisch says about SWEAVE: since the underlying computer code is wholly integrated within the document itself, anytime there are changes to the underlying data or analyses or code, the report itself is automatically updated ON THE FLY! The next evolution of ideas for literate programming and dynamic documentation have emerged from the R programming and RStudio communities. In 2012, Yihui Xie (yeewhay she) released the R package called knitr. This package was inspired by SWEAVE, and thus combines R code with text typesetting for producing documents. Like SWEAVE, knitr works with LaTeX but it also works with rmarkdown, which uses simple text markup syntax based on the original “markdown” package. The primary “markdown” package was introduced by John Gruber in 2004 to make it easier to “markup” plain text files for generating HTML documents – ideally without having to learn HTML. The rmarkdown package you’ll use throughout this course is built upon John Gruber’s “markdown”. Rmarkdown itself was fully released in 2014 and its original objective was creating documents for the internet by creating HTML formatted documents. However, the “rmarkdown” package also leverages Pandoc for creating an even wider array of documentation formats – including: The DOC format, as used by Microsoft WORD or Google Docs The ODT format used by Libre Office The PDF format EPUB for electronic-books Slide shows using HTML5 And the original TeX document formats and related TeX based slide formats like Beamer. In this course, you won’t interact directly with Pandoc, but it has been bundled with RStudio since 2015– so when you install RStudio, you’ll also get the functionality of Pandoc. If you would like to learn more about Pandoc, you can visit their website at pandoc.org. Since Pandoc can convert many different document formats, it’s often called the “swiss army knife” for document conversion. Pandoc is extremely versatile, allowing conversion between HTML web-based formats, word processor type formats, electronic publishing (or EPUB) formats, presentation slide-based formats, publication layout formats, TeX based formats, and many others. Ultimately, the RStudio Interactive Development Environment becomes our central “HUB” for combining the capabilities of: The great packages of “knitr” and “rmarkdown” with the built-in functionality of Pandoc for document conversion plus the fantastic analysis and graphics capabilities of the R programming language. From the RStudio interface, we can access all of this functionality and create documents on the fly in multiple formats for multiple end uses and products. "],
["whyrep.html", "Chapter 2 Why Reproducibility? 2.1 Data 2.2 Organization &amp; Workflow 2.3 Dissemination 2.4 538.com 2.5 Saving Lives", " Chapter 2 Why Reproducibility? This chapter will also cover thinking about what kinds of work products and projectscan benefit from reproducible workflow principles - how to get organized and xxx 2.1 Data Data can be thought of as many different things. We often think of data as numbers or even short text in a spreadsheet. But more often than not, data is “unstructured.” Unstructured data includes text, which could come from multiple sources, including not only reports and documents, but books, blogs, and websites. Other kinds of data could be: Images and artwork video and other media interview transcripts and any other “RAW” materials needed to complete your project. Regardless of what kind of “data” you have, your data should be: high quality reviewed for completeness reviewed for mistakes and errors, and checked for changes or updates 2.2 Organization &amp; Workflow Because your projects may involve a variety of dynamic data, how do you ensure your reproducible workflow is always efficient? There are several principles to follow. The first starts with organization. Each project you work on should have its own file storage organization structure. Each document, code, script, and product should have a specific purpose, and the versions of these files should all be tracked with a version control system without creating multiple copies of the files. Following this lecture, I’ve included a reading page with a helpful example of great organizational structure on Github. File names should be: readable by the computer, easy to search, easy to sort (especially by date and author if needed) human readable with logical naming schemes and contain enough info so a human knows what is in the file and what the file is for and short enough to be reasonably manageable consider user-based access and security (partitioned by “need to know” [users with editing and write permissions versus users with read-only access] Having an organizational structure for your project is a good idea even if your project only includes yourself, because: projects grow you may need to support numerous documents and files And relationships change and can become complex No matter what kind of product you want to produce, there should also be instructions on how to use and combine the files in your project. Your documentation is another important component, and it should be clear and well-defined so it can be easily understood by team members at all levels. The documentation could also follow literate programming principles combining the code + text + figures in one document. Ideally, your final workflow will allow any changes and updates to be automatically incorporated into your final product. You should write code/scripts to automate: raw data to processed output creating and removing temporary files creating tables, figures and other components assembling the components into final documents, products, and rendering documents into multiple-desired formats Standardization is also a critical component. Your documentation, code, or templates might be used again in other projects and should be standardized for easier integration and efficiency. You don’t want to reinvent any wheels if you can help it. Finally, your files, documents, and code should be stored and shared in a centralized way. Cloud-based computing often provides centralized storage and sharing of your projects with your team members and external stakeholders. 2.3 Dissemination Once your project is complete, you should disseminate your work. Why? To store and share your data and code. Odds are you will reuse something from this project in a future project. To fulfill expectations/requirements to disseminate your findings by the funding agency or publisher of your work To increase visibility - when you are listed as the source, you become, by default, THE subject matter expert! To increase the speed of collaboration for faster advancement of science and knowledge in your field, and finally To increase goodwill with the community and public Some ways to disseminate your work using Cloud-based solutions are: Dropbox Google drive Github (better with version control and tracking) Other ways to disseminate may be through: Journals - articles, manuscripts Books Blogs/Websites RSS (Rich Site Summary) feeds – like news feeds Rpubs – which we will discuss and try out in future lessons in this course Other online book platforms such as Gitbook and Bookdown Some examples of data repositories are: GenBank PDB In addition to Github, other data and code sharing repositories include: Bitbucket Dryad Figshare Zenodo A helpful article was published in 2013 in the journal PLOS Computational Biology entitled “Ten Simple Rules for Reproducible Computational Research.” While the article focused on applications in computational biology, the key principles they recommended still apply, and include: avoid manual steps use version control and tracking implement standardized formats store and track raw data organize your output – their list recommends a hierarchical organization link textual documentation to the results and make the work transparent by allowing public access to scripts, runs, and results When considering standard practices, think about your own work: What do you want to automate? What could you re-use? For example, code, files, formatting, graphics, logos, header, footer, boilerplate? What should you share with your team? What do you find yourself doing over and over? correcting or reformatting? If you won the lottery today and left your job, what do you need to tell your replacement so that they can pick up where you left off and complete your current tasks? The purpose of this course is to help you find the answers to these questions to improve your own workflow, teamwork, and efficiency! 2.4 538.com A good example of an organization that follows reproducible principles is 538.com. They write and host stories and opinion pieces covering politics, economics, health, popular culture, and sports. The founder, Nate Silver, and the 538 team are best known for their political polling and forecasting during the United States Presidential and related elections since 2008. Most of their articles provide references and links to their original data sources, and they also host their data, code, and details behind their analyses on their Github, which is available to the public. We’re going to work with some of these datasets later in this course using the “fivethirtyeight” R package. It’s also worth mentioning Andrew Flowers, one of the contributors to the ‘fivethirtyeight’ R Package. He gave a great presentation at the 2017 RStudio conference on how to tell stories using data, and he highlighted the various aspects of “data journalism” and importance of workflow, data processing, and transparency in analysis and communication. These are all key aspects of reproducibility. 2.5 Saving Lives To really see the power and importance of reproducible workflow principles, let’s go back in history to 2001 where an outbreak of a deadly strain of e.coli bacteria killed 50 people in Europe. Researchers at the Beijing Genomics Institute worked in collaboration with the Medical Center in Hamburg-Eppendorf to rapidly sequence the genome of the e.coli pathogen. Given the severity of the outbreak, the team announced and released the genome via Twitter to the world-wide community of microbial genomicists. A Github repository was established to “crowdsource” analysis and research to find a treatment. People started contributing their work in under 24 HOURS, and within 5 DAYS a bacterial agent was proposed to kill the pathogen. This case highlights the importance of these methods and work practices not only for speed and efficiency but also for rapidly addressing problems and developing solutions to save lives. "],
["getstarted.html", "Chapter 3 Getting Started 3.1 R 3.2 RStudio 3.3 Github 3.4 GIT 3.5 R Packages 3.6 other", " Chapter 3 Getting Started This chapter will cover the software tools needed - installing R, RStudio, GIT and Github to get started. And will include installing the various packages needed for the exercises in this book. 3.1 R So what is R? R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. R is based on the S language and environment which was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&amp;T, now Lucent Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues. R is Free - both in terms of no cost but also as FREELY distributed and shared under the GNU general public licensing. To learn more about R, you should visit the R-project website. This site provides good information about what R is, who the key contributors are, and information about the development of the R language. Links are provided for the manuals, frequently asked questions, and other resources like books about R and “The R Journal”. At the top of the page is a link to CRAN or C-RAN where you can download the R software. Go ahead to the CRAN website to download R. The link from the R project website, takes you to the list of “mirrors” or servers around the world that host the code and files and installers for installing R. You should pick the mirror closest to your geographic location. For example, at the bottom is the list of mirror sites for the United States. The one hosted by Duke University is closest to my location. You can also access this download page by directly going to https://cran.r-project.org/ At the top, there are links for the different operating systems for Windows, Mac or Linux. Choose the one for your operating system. For Windows, you’ll want to click on the link for the “base” installer. This will take you to a page with a link to the executable (EXE) file that you’ll need to download and run to install R on a Windows computer. When you click on the link for the Mac operating system, you are provided the link to the package (PKG) file needed to install R on your Mac. Go ahead and take a few minutes to download the installer needed for your operating system. Run the installer, follow the instructions, and accept the defaults to install R on your computer. Once R is installed, for example, on a windows computer, you will see R listed in your /Start/Programs list and may also have the R program icons shown on your desktop. It is worth noting that this is the minimum software you need to use R. For example, we can run the R program and when it opens you get a simple command line interface. You can use this to submit and execute R commands. For example: you can do simple math like typing in 2+2, or finding the mean of an array of numbers like mean(c(1,2,3,4,5)). Try this out on your computer to test and make sure R is up and running on your system before installing RStudio. 3.2 RStudio Programming in R using the basic interface is not the best way. Let’s also go ahead and download and install the RStudio software. RStudio is a fully integrated development environment (IDE) and is the key interface we’ll use for the rest of the course. Not only does RStudio link directly to R and provide a much better programming interface, RStudio allows you to create great rmarkdown documents in multiple formats and then links everything to your Github repository with version control using Git. We’ll cover Github and Git in the next lesson. Go to https://www.rstudio.com/ I encourage you to explore the many other products and services available from the RStudio organization. Check out their resources, which include free webinars, videos, and online learning. But let’s go ahead and download and install RStudio. Go to products and click on RStudio desktop. We will be using the FREE Open Source edition. Click on Download RStudio Desktop. Click the download button for the FREE version – this scrolls down to a list of installers. You need to read the file names to find the one right for your operating system. The first link is for the Windows installer, next is Mac followed by various flavors of Linux. You’ll want the “Installers” not the “TarBalls or “Source Code” – these are primarily for developers. Go ahead and take a few minutes to download and install RStudio and get it up and running on your computer. Once RStudio is up and running, you should see something that looks like this. We will explore this interface further in future lessons, but for now, let’s look at a few basic things. The main window on the left is the same basic “console/command line” window that you saw when you ran the basic R software. Like before, we can type commands and R code here. Like 2+2 and mean(c(1,2,3,4,5)). But you’ll notice there are more windows on the right side including information on your environment, history, files, plots, packages, help and viewer. To learn more about the RStudio interface, I’ve included several helpful links in a reading page after this video lecture. There are literally thousands of resources for learning more about both R and RStudio. Just pick your favorite search engine and search for tutorials on R and RStudio. 3.3 Github So what is Github? It’s a cloud repository, which hosts things like code, files and documents. It’s very similar to Dropbox, Google drive and Microsoft’s One Drive. However, Github also includes version control and tracking using Git, which we’ll get to shortly. Github has a web-based interface that includes support for desktop and mobile integration. Github provides access control and collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis. It also has native support and interpretation of markdown that’s much easier to use and write than HTML. We’re going to learn more about markdown at the end of this module. So let’s set up your Github account. Go to https://github.com. Choose a Good Username for Your Github Account Pick something professional that represents you. This will be your identity on Github and will be viewable by everyone. NOTE: For this course, I assume that you are creating a PUBLIC Github account, which is FREE. You can create a PRIVATE Github account for a fee. You can register one Github account per email. Once you get logged into your Github Account, go to your account settings to customize your photo, bio, email, website URL, and more… When you first get started you won’t have any repositories, but we will be creating repositories for each project.   [BEGIN computer demo] [NOTES TO MYSELF - COMPUTER DEMO] Show create account and log in screen Once you are signed in, click on the icon on the top right – click the pull down arrow to see selection options…such as accessing your profile and settings Click on your settings – check your name and email. These are IMPORTANT – you need to know these to set up Git for version control and connectivity from your cloud account to your local computer Add your bio summary, a URL, your photo, and any other information you want to share with everyone View your profile page – this is your “home” on Github – your page will look different from mine. When you first create your account you won’t have any repositories. However, we will be creating new repositories for this course shortly. [END computer demo] 3.4 GIT Details in installing GIT Now that you have your Github account created and you are logged in, we’re going to install Git. GIT is a source code management system for software development. It was designed and developed in 2005 by the Linux developers. GIT is a distributed version control system with complete history &amp; version-tracking capabilities. You may have heard of other version control systems, like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase. Unlike some of these, GIT is FREE (cost) and freely distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License. [BEGIN computer demo] [NOTES TO MYSELF - COMPUTER DEMO] Download and install Git from https://git-scm.com/ - click “Downloads” – at the lower left side of the web page This opens another web page. This page has the links for downloading the installer files for Mac, Linux and Windows operating systems. Choose the download link for your operating system – NOTE: Clicking these links starts the file download. Run the installer you just downloaded to install Git on your computer. Follow the instructions and accept the defaults. For example on my windows computer, I can go to the start programs and see that Git was installed and has 3 options for running GIT: Git Bash – for this course we will use the Git Bash option Git CMD And Git GUI [computer demo continued] 3.5 R Packages Details on what R packages are, why you need them, and how to install them. 3.6 other Latex optional… word, open office, google docs, powerpoint, Internet browser software (IE, Edge, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, xxx) "],
["gitexercise.html", "Chapter 4 Exercise with GIT &amp; Github 4.1 Using Git and Github 4.2 Using the RStudio Interface", " Chapter 4 Exercise with GIT &amp; Github 4.1 Using Git and Github Now that you have Git installed on your computer and you’ve created your Github account, let’s test your setup. Open your browser and log back into your Github account Click on your Profile, and then Click on Repositories – now we’re going to create a new repository Click NEW to create a new repository. type in a name for your repository such as “MyFirstRepo” put in a short description like “My First Github Repository” this will be a PUBLIC repository, but as you can see if you have paid for a PRIVATE Github account you do have the option to create Private repositories Go ahead and click the box to select “Initialize this repository with a README” keep everything else the same (use the defaults) click “Create Repository” It takes a moment for the repository to be created, but you’ll notice that your repository now has 1 file in it. README.md, which is your readme for the repository. Now we’re going to connect everything back to your local drive using Git. We need to create a place on your local drive where you want to save your work for this course. We’re going to end up creating multiple repositories for this course, so I create a central folder on your computer like C:\\RepTemplates where you’ll keep everything organized. You can see this folder created on my computer. It is this folder where I will store and link all of my Github repositories for this course. Let’s go ahead and run GIT. As I mentioned, we will use the Git Bash command window for running and executing GIT commands. Once the GIT Bash window opens, you’ll see some information and details in the window about what directory/folder it’s currently in. On my system, GIT Bash defaults to my “users” directory. However, we want to change out of this directory. Keep typing cd .. until you get to the main “C” drive. Then we’re going to change to the RepTemplates folder we just created. Type cd RepTemplates You should see the directory folder change at the GIT Bash command line, but you can also type the command pwd To get the “path with directory” to verify that you ended in your C:\\RepTemplates folder as intended. We can also view the contents of this folder, by typing either ls To “list” the files in this directory or you can also type dir To get a “directory” listing of the contents. You’ll notice at the moment there is nothing in this folder. That’s fine. That’s correct. In a minute we’re going to link back up to our newly create Github repository “MyFirstRepo”. [END computer demo] As we go through this course, I will refer many times to the book by Jenny Bryan entitled: Happy Git and Github for the useR You can access this book for FREE online at http://happygitwithr.com/ There’s a lot of good information on setting up R and RStudio and for getting setup using Git and Github. [BEGIN computer demo] Now to get started using GIT, you need to “introduce yourself.” At this point, you should already be logged into your Github account. But we need to make sure that GIT understands how to talk to your Github account. So, we’re going to type in 3 GIT commands in your GIT Bash window. Open your GIT Bash window. This first command tells GIT your name – be sure to type in the same name you used when you set up your Github account. Your name goes between the 2 single quote marks. git config --global user.name 'Jennifer Bryan' Next we also have to tell GIT the email account you used when you set up your Github account. Again put your email in between the 2 single quote marks. git config --global user.email 'jenny@stat.ubc.ca' Finally, to check to make sure everything went in correctly, type in the following GIT command to list your global settings and you should see the user.name and user.email you just typed in. git config --global –list If you see these, CONGRATULATIONS you have successfully introduced yourself to GIT!! KEEP your GIT Bash window open. [END computer demo] “pushmi-pullyu” SLIDE with PUSH / PULL GRAPHIC – insert here We’ll be using the terms PUSH and PULL to talk about moving files back and forth from our local computer to the Github cloud repository and from the cloud back to our local computer. The “pushmi-pullyu” was a fictional animal in the Doctor Dolittle series of children’s books by Hugh Lofting with two heads on opposite ends of its body, so you never knew if the animal was coming or going. Hopefully, we won’t have that confusion in this course, but we will be PUSH’ing and PULL’ing content in and out of your project repository between your local computer and your Github account using Git version control. A PULL moves content from the cloud to your local computer. A PUSH moves content from your local computer to the cloud. [BEGIN computer demo] Now let’s CLONE your Github repository to copy the repository contents from your Github cloud repository down to your local computer. Open your browser, and go to your “MyFirstRepo” repository. At the top right, there’s a green button to “Clone or Download” your repository. Just below that green button, there’s a little icon to the right to “copy to the clipboard” the long URL address you will need when we use GIT to clone your repository. [END computer demo] First PULL to Clone your repository SLIDE – insert graphic illustrating a PULL from the cloud When you CLONE your repository, this is your first PULL. You will be PULLing the content down from your Github account to your local computer. [BEGIN computer demo] To execute a clone using GIT, open your GIT Bash window. Check to make sure you are in your C:\\RepTemplates directory. Go back to the “MyFirstRepo” repository and click “copy to clipboard” to get the Github repo URL. Make sure you have the option for “Clone with HTTPS” shown to get the correct URL. Back in GIT Bash, Type git clone followed by the URL. Since the URL is now COPYied into your “clipboard”, you can PASTE it into the GIT Bash window git clone https://github.com/melindahiggins2001/MyFirstRepo.git This will take a minute to run, but it should say that it is cloning your repository and you should not get any errors. Now type in a ls or dir command to view the contents of your directory. You should now see a new folder created called “MyFirstRepo” in your C:\\RepTemplates directory. Then type in cd MyFirstRepo to change into this new directory and type ls or dir to view the contents. VIOLA!! You should now see the README.md file in this directory. You can also see this file by viewing the directory contents in your file explorer. You may also be able to see a hidden folder called /.git which was created when you did the clone. If you can’t see this folder, that’s OK- it’s usually hidden by default. I changed the settings on my computer so I can view these hidden folders. [END computer demo] TADA!! You have now successfully cloned your Github repository and have it linked from your local computer to Github using version control and tracking with GIT!! We’re going to do this again in the next part using the RStudio interface. 4.2 Using the RStudio Interface Let’s take a moment and look at some of the other content in the Happy Git and Github for the user book by Jenny Bryan. http://happygitwithr.com/. There are many chapters in this book you may want to read and take a look at. For example, chapter 5 has information on setting up a Github account and chapter 6 has information on installing or upgrading both R and RStudio which you’ve already done. And chapter 7 covers installing Git which you’ve also already done. Then in Chapter 8 there is information on introducing yourself to GIT which you’ve just completed. If you would like to move beyond using just the Git Bash window and command line interface for using Git for version control, I recommend reading Chapter 9 on installing a more full-featured Git client. Jenny Bryan recommends either SourceTree or GitKracken. Chapter 10 covers getting connected to Github which you just completed. We’re going to spend some time in this next part of the lesson, learning about setting up credentials on your computer using either HTTPS or SSH to securely connect to your Github account. These details are covered in chapters 11 and 12. There is additional information in chapters 13, 14 and 15 on using RStudio with Git to connect to Github and manage your projects. I will be showing you how to use RStudio to connect to Github using Git shortly. The later chapters 16, 17 and 18 provide examples of linking up projects with Github depending on whether the project is new or existing and whether you setup the project on Github first or last. For the projects we will be doing in this course, we will be creating new projects by setting up Github first. The next section of the book provides some workflow examples. I point out Chapter 22 which covers Git commands some of which you’ve already learned. I also mention Chapter 26 entitled Burn it all down which is helpful to read when you have problems and Git stops communicating between Github and RStudio. Now we’re going to connect to your Github account using Git but from the RStudio interface instead of from the Git Bash window. Go ahead and start RStudio. When you open RStudio you should see a screen similar to this but it won’t look exactly like this and that is OK. Your layout should be similar. There are a few options we need to review and setup to make sure that RStudio known that you want to use Git. In the tools menu, click on Global options. Click on the button for GIT/SVN. In this window we want to make sure that the box is checked for “enable version control interface for RStudio projects”. Next we need to find where the GIT executable file is located on your computer. On my computer it is located on my program files folder for Git/bin. For example, if I click browse it shows where this is on my computer’s hard drive. You’ll notice that the file is named “git.exe” and is located in the “/bin” folder. You may also see an icon like the one shown here next to the filename. There is also a similar file under the “/cmd” folder, but this is NOT the one we want. We also DO NOT want the file for “git-bash.exe” NOR the one names “git-cmd.exe” Also make sure you have the box checked for “Use Git Bash as shell for Git projects”. This why I showed you earlier how to use the Git Bash shell window with your projects. Since we’re not using SVN you can ignore the line for SVN executable [END COMPUTER DEMO] [BACK TO SLIDES] Now that we’ve got some of the options setup in RStudio for using Git, we next need to setup your Github account credentials on your computer so that each time you run a GIT command to connect and sync to your Github account you won’t have to keep typing in your login name and password. You can setup your credentials by using either HTTPS (hyper text transfer protocol secure) or SSH (Secure Shell). These are two different approaches for setting up your credentials. I’m going to show you how to setup SSH from RStudio. [BEGIN COMPUTER DEMO] Back in RStudio in the Global options window for Git/SVN options, were going to setup your SSH RSA Key. This is for setting up a public key/private key cryptosystem. Click on the button to “Create RSA Key” and use the defaults. This is where you create the key. You can add a pass phrase or password, but this is optional. Note where on your hard drive it tells you where the security key will be created. Then click “create” to create your key. If you’d like to view your public key, click on the link to the right. Once you’re done, click OK Let’s double check that GIT also now sees your SSH Key. Open your Git Bash window and type in this command ls –al ~/.ssh When you do this, you should see two files id_rsa (which is your private key) and id_rsa.pub (which is your public key). This is explained in more detail in the Happy Git book in chapter 12.2. You can also click the [?] Using Version Control with RStudio to get to the help webpages at RStudio. Make sure you are in the local directory for your new repository C:/RepTemplates/MyFirstRepo. You should see this listed in your Git Bash window prompt or you can also type pwd to get the “path with directory” You can double check your settings in the git bash window by typing git config –global --list You should be pretty much setup and ready to go at this point. If you are still getting errors, you might have a credentialing conflict. For example, if you have multiple Github accounts with different emails, you might have to remove one credential and add the other one instead.
