Higgins 2018-01-20 Preface aaaaaaaaaaaa Why read this book aaaaaaaaaaaaa Structure of the book aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa Software information and conventions aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa Acknowledgments aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa Prerequisites This is a sample book written in Markdown. You can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). The bookdown package can be installed from CRAN or Github: Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #. To compile this example to PDF, you need to install XeLaTeX. Colophon R Packages Used in This Book This book will use the R programming language (R Core Team 2017) with the following R packages: bookdown (Xie 2017a) rmarkdown (Allaire et al. 2018) knitr (Xie 2017b) dplyr (Wickham et al. 2017) ggplot2 (Wickham and Chang 2016) printr (Xie 2017c) fivethirtyeight (Ismay and Chunn 2017) Other external refs, book (Xie 2015), and the FAD ref (Miller et al. 1985).

["intro.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction", " Chapter 1 Introduction You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 1. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 3. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. Figure 1.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 1.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 1.1. Table 1.1: Here is a nice table!
