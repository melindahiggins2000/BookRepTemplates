# Reproducible Templates

This book is based on the Coursera Course "Reproducible Templates for Analysis and Dissemination", [https://www.coursera.org/learn/reproducible-templates-analysis](https://www.coursera.org/learn/reproducible-templates-analysis)

**Coursera Course Description:** _"This course will assist you with recreating work that a previous coworker completed, revisiting a project you abandoned some time ago, or simply reproducing a document with a consistent format and workflow. Incomplete information about how the work was done, where the files are, and which is the most recent version can give rise to many complications. This course  focuses on the proper documentation creation process, allowing you and your colleagues to easily reproduce the components of your workflow. Throughout this course, you'll receive helpful demonstrations of RStudio and the R Markdown language and engage in active learning opportunities to help you build a professional online portfolio."_

The Course consists of 5 Modules:

1. Introduction to Reproducible Research and Dynamic Documentation
