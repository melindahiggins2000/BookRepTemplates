## Parameterization

Using the `$` selector for setting parameters easily modified in 1 place (in YAML) at top of document rather than having to make numerous edits throughout a given document.

Adding a `shiny` based selector tool to make it even easier

## Batch processes

Leveraging these `$` parameters, we can write a script that runs a batch process across a set of conditions (range of dates, locations, etc) to create multiple customized reports using only 1 core document.
